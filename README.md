# Hi there, I'm MatÃ­as LÃ³pez! ðŸ‘‹

I am finishing my degree in electronic engineering, I am a person who likes to be constantly learning and I am passionate about everything related to the development of embedded systems. As objectives for this year I hope to be able to collaborate with other people so that it allows me to grow as a human being, developer, and engineer and also to continue learning from this beautiful community that is open source.

## ðŸ”­Projects:

### ðŸŽ“ Final Degree Project 

Is a measuring station based on the low-power MSP430 microcontroller (MSP430FR4133). This is responsible for the collection and storage of data in real-time, resulting from the sensing of various agricultural variables. It communicates wirelessly with a base station that concentrates the information and coordinates the communication. Supports I2C, UART, 1-Wire, pulses, and analog devices.
